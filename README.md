#Objective
With the rise of remote work and cloud services, stolen credentials pose a significant security risk. Attackers often log in from unusual locations, devices, or times, which traditional systems fail to detect. Our solution leverages AI/ML to detect anomalous logins and prevent account takeovers, helping secure sensitive data for enterprises and financial institutions.

#Problem Statement
Traditional security systems often miss subtle anomalies in login behavior, leading to account takeovers.

#Solution
Our system is an intelligent security solution that leverages AI/ML to detect and prevent account takeovers by analyzing login behavior patterns and detects suspicious logins using:
    Geo-location analysis
    Device fingerprinting
    Login time patterns
    Network anomalies (IP reputation, ASN, ISP checks)
    User-behavioral modeling (pattern recognition of normal activity)
    Brute force login detection (multiple failed attempts)
Output: Risk Score (0-100) + Prediction (normal/anomalous) + Reasons

#Users
    IT Security Teams
    Cloud Security Analysts
    End-users (real-time protection)

#Expected Outcomes
    An AI/ML model that identifies suspicious logins without disrupting legitimate users.
    A real-time detection system to flag or challenge anomalous logins.

#Potential Impact
    Prevent credential theft and account takeover.
    Improve enterprise and financial data security.
    Reduce fraud risks for BFSI and IT enterprises.

#Setup & Installation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
    First, download the project from the repository and move into the project folder.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Setup (Django + MySQL)
    - Create and activate virtual environment:
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
        venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
    - Install dependencies:
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - Configure MySQL database in settings.py:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
                'NAME': '<db_name>',
                'USER': '<db_user>',
                'PASSWORD': '<db_password>',
                'HOST': 'localhost',
                'PORT': '3306',
            }
        }
    - Apply migrations & run server:
        python manage.py migrate
        python manage.py runserver
3Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Setup (AngularJS + Chart.js + FingerprintJS)
    - Navigate to the frontend folder inside the project.
    - Install the necessary frontend libraries (AngularJS, Chart.js, FingerprintJS). (but using weblinks to all three js)
4Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Model Setup
    - Ensure the required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost) are installed.
    - If training scripts are included, run the training step to generate the model.
    - If the ML model is served separately (e.g., as a Flask or Django API service), start that service so it can interact with the backend.
    - Ensure Python libraries are installed:
        pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost
5Ô∏è‚É£ Integration
    - The frontend interacts with the Django backend APIs to fetch and display data.
    - The backend integrates with external APIs (AbuseIPDB, IPQualityScore) for IP and proxy detection.
    - The ML model is embedded into the backend pipeline to provide risk scoring for login attempts.

#ML Model Architecture
Input Layer (Features)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Geo-location vectors (latitude, longitude, country)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Device fingerprints (browser, OS, screen resolution)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Temporal patterns (login time, frequency)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Network indicators (IP reputation, ASN, ISP)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Behavioral metrics (typing patterns, navigation)

Ensemble Model
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ XGBoost Classifier (50% weight) - Supervised learning
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Isolation Forest (50% weight) - Unsupervised anomaly detection

Output: Risk Score (0-100) + Prediction (normal/anomalous) + Reasons
